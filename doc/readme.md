## Getting Started

This is a small IoT application working on Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT using Python language to serve a number of different tasks and requirements. During the development process, a variety of technologies and tools have been applied. Following is the description of the project repository.

### Repo status

This respository is private and shared between 2 contributors as stated above.

### Branches

There are 4 different branches beside the default master including bluetooth, context, emoji and game. Contributors are using different branches to develop the corresponding solutions. 

## Activities

This project is being developed for around 4 weeks. Git and git hub have been used from the beginning of the project to manage the work and help contributors to collaborate with each other. 

```
Contributors pull code from the appropriate branch everytime to continue working on the solution. Commit and push activities happen continuously after some new parts of the solution are coded serveral times per week or per day.
```
```
Finalized solution is merged to master branch after being checked for the first half of the cycle. 
For the second half of the cycle when context solution is being finalized, it also acts as a master branch when providing a new structurized format for all the project's modules, later solutions are checked and merged to this context branch. 
```
